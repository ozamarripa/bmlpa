This folder contains 3 parallel version of the LFM algorithm and one parallel version of the BMLPA algorithm.

The BMLPA algorithm needs as parameters:
-i network file 
-on2c output file n2c 
-oc2n output file c2n 
-p threshold [0.1-1.0]

The OpenMP and OpenCL LFM algortihms needs as parameters: 
-f inputfilepath

The OpenMP+MPI LFM algorithm needs as parameters
-f inputfilepath
-maxa max value of alpha that will be explored
-mina starting value of alpha that will be explored
-range step size
